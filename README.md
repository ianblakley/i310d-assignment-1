Project Goal:
  My goal of this project was to create visualizations of the countries with the most success at the Summer and Winter Olympics.

Source:
  All project data comes directly from this Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table

Data Type:
  The data is made entirely of strings (country names) and integers (medal counts). The data collected is also considered to be ratio data, as the data has a zero point and ratioes can be computed from any two numbers in the DataFrame.

Potential Bias:
  These charts are not a completely accurate reflection of each country's athletic ability. Different countries have different populations as well as different resources that allow for them to have a better or worse chance of success in the Olympics compared to other countries. This data is only meant to reflect the success of countries in the Olympics, not make any statements about each country's athletic abilities.
